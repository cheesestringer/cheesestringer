### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm the creator of Salary Seeker and Property Seeker, extensions built to take the hassle out of job searching and property hunting. I love to create tools that help save you time, effort, and money.

### Salary Seeker

The easiest way to support me is by submitting ratings for the extensions that have helped you out.\
